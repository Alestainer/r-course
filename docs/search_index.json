Student Learning Objectives To be familiar with standard techniques for visualizing data, including heat maps, contour plots, etc. To be able to transform raw data into formats suitable for analysis To be able to perform basic exploratory analysis To be able to create data visualizations in R There is no prerequisite for this course. Resources Required Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation: Available as a free PDF (https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) or for $8.49 on Amazon. Recommended: R Graphics Cookbook RStudio Cheat Sheets Course Requirements Grades for this course will be based on weekly assignments (30%), project assignments (30%), the project proposal (5%), the final project deliverable (20%), and final project presentation participation (15%). Weekly assignments (30%) Weekly assignments are short R excercises. Each exercise should take no longer than 15 minutes. You will typically be given time to complete the exercise in class the day the assignment is given. The assignment will be in the form of R Markdown file (*.Rmd). You will submit the completed assignments via classroom.google.com by the following class period. Individual Project Project assignments (30%) Each week, leading up to the project proposal, you will be given an assignment that is designed to provide you with an organized workflow for approaching new data science projects. Project assignments are submitted via classroom.google.com, with the exception of the two presentations Project proposal presentation (5%) This presentation should be less than 2 minutes. You simply need to communicate the core question your project seeks to answer and the dataset(s) you will be using to answer this question. Final project (20%) The final project will be an R Markdown document which communicates your project question, the data you used, and your results. You will need to deliver both your R Markdown file and any necessary data for running the file. Final project presentation participation (15%) Your final project participation grade is based on a combination of your own presentation and the feedback you provide to your classmates. Schedule The following schedule is tentative and subject to change. Typically, the Tuesday class will consist of the week’s R lecture. Depending on how quickly we get through the material, you will have time to work on your assignment that will be due before the following class period. On Thursdays, we will discuss a relevant topic, but you should have time to work on your project assignment for the week. That assignment will generally be due before the following class period, except for the last several weeks when you are completing your final project.

Make sure that the rmarkdown library is installed: install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) For each assignment, you will create an R Markdown file (*.Rmd) and submit that file by the following class session using classroom.google.com. Each class has been made using R Markdown, so you can find many examples by going to the GitHub repository for this course github.com/jonpage/r-course 1.2 Working with data already loaded into R Base R comes with a set of sample data that is useful for illustrating techniques in R. Run the following command to see a list of the datasets in the core library datasets: library(help = &quot;datasets&quot;) These datasets are accessible automatically. We’ll start with the Swiss Fertility and Socioeconomic Inicators (1888) dataset. See a description of the dataset by using the help command, either ?swiss or help(swiss). This dataset is technically a data.frame, which you can see by using the command class(swiss). For more information on data.frames take a look at the documentation(help(data.frame)) 1.2.1 Numeric summaries Here are a few ways we can summarize a dataset: head() shows us the first six rows of a data.frame. head(swiss) ## Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic ## Courtelary 80.2 17.0 15 12 9.96 ## Delemont 83.1 45.1 6 9 84.84 ## Franches-Mnt 92.5 39.7 5 5 93.40 ## Moutier 85.8 36.5 12 7 33.77 ## Neuveville 76.9 43.5 17 15 5.16 ## Porrentruy 76.1 35.3 9 7 90.57 ## Infant.Mortality ## Courtelary 22.2 ## Delemont 22.2 ## Franches-Mnt 20.2 ## Moutier 20.3 ## Neuveville 20.6 ## Porrentruy 26.6 summary() provides summary statistics for each column in a data.frame. summary(swiss) ## Fertility Agriculture Examination Education ## Min. :35.00 Min. : 1.20 Min. : 3.00 Min. : 1.00 ## 1st Qu.:64.70 1st Qu.:35.90 1st Qu.:12.00 1st Qu.: 6.00 ## Median :70.40 Median :54.10 Median :16.00 Median : 8.00 ## Mean :70.14 Mean :50.66 Mean :16.49 Mean :10.98 ## 3rd Qu.:78.45 3rd Qu.:67.65 3rd Qu.:22.00 3rd Qu.:12.00 ## Max. :92.50 Max. :89.70 Max. :37.00 Max. :53.00 ## Catholic Infant.Mortality ## Min. : 2.150 Min. :10.80 ## 1st Qu.: 5.195 1st Qu.:18.15 ## Median : 15.140 Median :20.00 ## Mean : 41.144 Mean :19.94 ## 3rd Qu.: 93.125 3rd Qu.:21.70 ## Max. :100.000 Max. :26.60 1.2.2 Visual summaries Scatterplot matrix (default plot of a data.frame): plot(swiss) # or pairs(swiss) Scatterplot of two dimensions plot(swiss[,c(&quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Fertility&quot;)]) # or plot(swiss[4,1]) # or plot(swiss$Education, swiss$Fertility) # or plot(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Education) Smoothed Scatterplot of two dimensions smoothScatter(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Examination) Scatterplot with a loess (locally weighted polynomial regression) scatter.smooth(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Agriculture) 1.2.3 Distribution plots Histograms: hist(swiss$Catholic) Stem-and-Leaf Plots: stem(swiss$Fertility) ## ## The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the right of the | ## ## 3 | 5 ## 4 | 35 ## 5 | 46778 ## 6 | 124455556678899 ## 7 | 01223346677899 ## 8 | 0233467 ## 9 | 223 Kernel density plot (and add a rug showing where observation occur): plot(density(swiss$Fertility)) rug(swiss$Fertility) Boxplots: boxplot(swiss) 1.2.3.1 More complicated charts Conditioning plots: coplot(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Examination | as.factor(swiss$Catholic &gt; 50)) Star plots (half-star plots here): stars(swiss, key.loc = c(15,1), flip.labels = FALSE, full = FALSE) 1.3 Assignment Create a new R Markdown file.

Here’s how to modify the above chart to display income in logs: pop_hi &lt;- pop_hi %&gt;% mutate(log_safe_wages = ifelse(wages == 0, 1, wages)) pop_hi %&gt;% ggplot(aes(age, log_safe_wages)) + geom_point() + scale_y_log10() 2.5 Heatmaps Heatmaps allow you to get a sense of the concetration of observations in regions where there are many overlapping points: ggplot(pop_hi, aes(age, log_safe_wages)) + geom_bin2d() + scale_y_log10() 2.6 Hexbins Hexbins use hexagons instead of squares, which helps avoid the rectangular sections in heatmaps that may misrepresent your data. You will need to install the hexbin package. install.packages(&quot;hexbin&quot;) pop_hi %&gt;% filter(wages &gt; 10000, wages &lt; 300000) %&gt;% ggplot(aes(age, wages)) + geom_hex() + scale_x_log10() Here we can see that inequality in wages for workers increases with age. 2.7 Other topics from this dataset This dataset includes information on the majors for degree holders and the industry codes. You could use that additional information to ask how well targeted majors are to particular industries and how incomes vary across choice of major. Because of the size of the data in the Hawaii sample, it would be better to ask some of these questions at the national level. Go to the ACS PUMS documentation page for more information. 2.8 Assignment Choose another pair of variables from the data dictionary and visualize them with a scatterplot, a heatmap, and a hexbin plot.

You may also want to set the range if there is metadata at the end of the table you are importing. range overrides any skip setting, so we wont have to specify the number of rows to skip. library(readxl) seats &lt;- read_excel(&quot;data/2017 Air Seat Forecast rev 0617.xls&quot;, col_names = c( &quot;dep_city&quot;, &quot;seats2017Q1&quot;, &quot;seats2017Q2&quot;, &quot;seats2017Q3&quot;, &quot;seats2017Q4&quot;, &quot;seats2017&quot;, &quot;seats2016Q1&quot;, &quot;seats2016Q2&quot;, &quot;seats2016Q3&quot;, &quot;seats2016Q4&quot;, &quot;seats2016&quot;, &quot;seatschangeQ1&quot;, &quot;seatschangeQ2&quot;, &quot;seatschangeQ3&quot;, &quot;seatschangeQ4&quot;, &quot;seatschange&quot; ), range = &quot;A5:P78&quot;) seats ## # A tibble: 74 x 16 ## dep_city seats2017Q1 seats2017Q2 seats2017Q3 seats2017Q4 seats2017 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 TOTAL 2987920 3016376 3168233 3050112 12222641 ## 2 SCHEDULED 2966915 2996155 3140998 3029794 12133862 ## 3 CHARTERS 21005 20221 27235 20318 88779 ## 4 &lt;NA&gt; NA NA NA NA NA ## 5 US TOTAL 1996549 2108969 2215424 2071513 8392455 ## 6 SCHEDULED 1978616 2091981 2200195 2055171 8325963 ## 7 CHARTERS 17933 16988 15229 16342 66492 ## 8 &lt;NA&gt; NA NA NA NA NA ## 9 US WEST 1717254 1837080 1943653 1817441 7315428 ## 10 Anchorage 25758 15105 13674 17013 71550 ## # ... with 64 more rows, and 10 more variables: seats2016Q1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # seats2016Q2 &lt;dbl&gt;, seats2016Q3 &lt;dbl&gt;, seats2016Q4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # seats2016 &lt;dbl&gt;, seatschangeQ1 &lt;dbl&gt;, seatschangeQ2 &lt;chr&gt;, ## # seatschangeQ3 &lt;chr&gt;, seatschangeQ4 &lt;dbl&gt;, seatschange &lt;dbl&gt; Let’s add a region identifier library(dplyr) us_west_range &lt;- 10:23 us_east_range &lt;- 26:33 japan_range &lt;- 40:45 canada_range &lt;- 48:52 other_asia_range &lt;-55:58 oceania_range &lt;- 61:64 other_range &lt;- 67:74 seats$region &lt;- NA seats[us_west_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;US West&quot; seats[us_east_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;US East&quot; seats[japan_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;Japan&quot; seats[canada_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;Canada&quot; seats[other_asia_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;Other Asia&quot; seats[oceania_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;Oceania&quot; seats[other_range,]$region &lt;- &quot;Other&quot; seats &lt;- seats %&gt;% filter(!is.na(region)) seats ## # A tibble: 49 x 17 ## dep_city seats2017Q1 seats2017Q2 seats2017Q3 seats2017Q4 ## &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; ## 1 Anchorage 25758 15105 13674 17013 ## 2 Bellingham 10198 318 NA 6519 ## 3 Denver 55803 51654 52585 43290 ## 4 Las Vegas 70514 74322 75839 75415 ## 5 Los Angeles 548935 647498 715338 647703 ## 6 Oakland 84571 104810 116015 90703 ## 7 Phoenix 113046 115125 125348 108863 ## 8 Portland 90207 71068 65997 81673 ## 9 Sacramento 37620 38318 38456 38456 ## 10 Salt Lake City 26370 23751 22968 28322 ## # ... with 39 more rows, and 12 more variables: seats2017 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # seats2016Q1 &lt;dbl&gt;, seats2016Q2 &lt;dbl&gt;, seats2016Q3 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # seats2016Q4 &lt;dbl&gt;, seats2016 &lt;dbl&gt;, seatschangeQ1 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # seatschangeQ2 &lt;chr&gt;, seatschangeQ3 &lt;chr&gt;, seatschangeQ4 &lt;dbl&gt;, ## # seatschange &lt;dbl&gt;, region &lt;chr&gt; 3.2 Facets Let’s do a simple plot comparing 2017 seats outlook to the 2016 seats outlook. library(ggplot2) seats %&gt;% ggplot(aes(seats2016, seats2017)) + geom_point() The distribution of this data looks like a good candidate for using the log scale (high concentration in lower values and lower concentration in higher values). seats %&gt;% ggplot(aes(seats2016, seats2017)) + geom_point() + scale_x_log10() + scale_y_log10() + geom_abline(lty = 2) # dashed line type (lty) Since we have region identifiers it would be nice to divide our data and see charts of each region side-by-side.

The following link provides a gallery of many of these extensions: ggplot2 extensions Some others that are usefull are ggjoy and GGally. 5.3 ggjoy Make sure ggjoy is installed. install.packages(&quot;ggjoy&quot;) ggjoy gives us the ability to stack kernel density plots. library(ggjoy) ggplot(tidy_acs, aes(x = median_income, y = location_last_year, group(location_last_year))) + geom_joy() + theme_joy() This plot shows us that, on average, the distance moved in the past year is inversely related to median income. 5.4 scatterplot matrix (GGally::ggscatmat) Make sure you have GGally installed. install.packages(&quot;GGally&quot;) One particular library, GGally, has a great set of visualizations to extend those that come prebuilt with ggplot. One common visualization tool that is missing from ggplot is the scatterplot matrix. While base R provides splom() in the lattice library, GGally::ggpairs and GGally::ggscatmat pr ovide an easy tool to create a scatterplot matrix with ggplot2. library(GGally) acs_mobility %&gt;% as.data.frame() %&gt;% ggscatmat(columns = 2:ncol(.), alpha = 0.1) 5.5 Assignment Go to American FactFinder. Follow the steps above up until the point where we typed out “income mobility”. This time pick another keyword to search for and select a different table to analyze (make sure this will give you more than two columns of data you would like to compare). Use ggscatmat() to visualize the variables that interest you. Keep the filenames as they are provided by the Census, so I can run your R Markdown file. "],

The boxplot highlights the median, key percentiles, and outliers within a dataset. The violin plot takes a kernel density plot, rotates it 90 degrees, then mirrors it about the axis to create a shape that sometimes resembles a violin. 6.1 Data The Social Security Administration releases data on earnings and employment each year.

In ggplot, the aes() function is used to create a mapping from your data to these visual properties. We most often use aes() to map our variables to the x and y dimension. Above, we used the fact that the first two arguments to aes() are x and y. That is, aes(x = life_satisfaction, y = annual_earnings) gives the same result as aes(life_satisfaction, annual_earnings) Anytime we want more than two dimensions of our data displayed, it’s useful to map the extra variables to other features of our graph (e.g., size, color, alpha, etc.). Let’s add number of children to our graph assigning children to color. (In ggplot both American and British spellings are supported, so you can use color or colour.) ggplot(ta, aes(life_satisfaction, annual_earnings, color = children)) + scale_y_log10() + geom_jitter() If the children variable was a factor, more distinct colors would have been chosen. We can see this by coloring by employment_status instead. ggplot(ta, aes(life_satisfaction, annual_earnings, color = employment_status)) + scale_y_log10() + geom_jitter() You can emphasize a variable by encoding in more than one visual aesthetic. Let’s map children to color, size, and alpha. ggplot(ta, aes(life_satisfaction, annual_earnings, color = children, size = children, alpha = children)) + scale_y_log10(&quot;Annual Earnings&quot;, labels = scales::dollar) + geom_jitter() 9.5 Assignment Open the codebook (data/TA2015_codebook.pdf) and search for two new variables to visualize and create a plot that makes use of both jitter and rug.

["probability.html", "Probability Hot Hands Saving your code Getting Started Compared to What? Simulations in R Simulating the Independent Shooter On your own", " Probability The source for this topic is the Open Intro labs https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php Hot Hands Basketball players who make several baskets in succession are described as having a hot hand. Fans and players have long believed in the hot hand phenomenon, which refutes the assumption that each shot is independent of the next. However, a 1985 paper by Gilovich, Vallone, and Tversky collected evidence that contradicted this belief and showed that successive shots are independent events (http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/Teaching/syllabi/7782/readings/gilovich%20vallone%20tversky.pdf). This paper started a great controversy that continues to this day, as you can see by Googling hot hand basketball. We do not expect to resolve this controversy today. However, in this lab we’ll apply one approach to answering questions like this. The goals for this lab are to (1) think about the effects of independent and dependent events, (2) learn how to simulate shooting streaks in R, and (3) to compare a simulation to actual data in order to determine if the hot hand phenomenon appears to be real.

Getting Started Our investigation will focus on the performance of one player: Kobe Bryant of the Los Angeles Lakers. His performance against the Orlando Magic in the 2009 NBA finals earned him the title Most Valuable Player and many spectators commented on how he appeared to show a hot hand. Let’s load some data from those games and look at the first several rows. load(&quot;data/kobe.RData&quot;) head(kobe) In this data frame, every row records a shot taken by Kobe Bryant. If he hit the shot (made a basket), a hit, H, is recorded in the column named basket, otherwise a miss, M, is recorded. Just looking at the string of hits and misses, it can be difficult to gauge whether or not it seems like Kobe was shooting with a hot hand. One way we can approach this is by considering the belief that hot hand shooters tend to go on shooting streaks. For this lab, we define the length of a shooting streak to be the number of consecutive baskets made until a miss occurs. For example, in Game 1 Kobe had the following sequence of hits and misses from his nine shot attempts in the first quarter: \\[ \\textrm{H M | M | H H M | M | M | M} \\] To verify this use the following command: kobe$basket[1:9] Within the nine shot attempts, there are six streaks, which are separated by a “|” above. Their lengths are one, zero, two, zero, zero, zero (in order of occurrence). What does a streak length of 1 mean, i.e. how many hits and misses are in a streak of 1? What about a streak length of 0? The custom function calc_streak, which was loaded in with the data, may be used to calculate the lengths of all shooting streaks and then look at the distribution. kobe_streak &lt;- calc_streak(kobe$basket) barplot(table(kobe_streak)) Note that instead of making a histogram, we chose to make a bar plot from a table of the streak data. A bar plot is preferable here since our variable is discrete – counts – instead of continuous. Describe the distribution of Kobe’s streak lengths from the 2009 NBA finals. What was his typical streak length? How long was his longest streak of baskets? Compared to What? We’ve shown that Kobe had some long shooting streaks, but are they long enough to support the belief that he had hot hands? What can we compare them to? To answer these questions, let’s return to the idea of independence. Two processes are independent if the outcome of one process doesn’t effect the outcome of the second. If each shot that a player takes is an independent process, having made or missed your first shot will not affect the probability that you will make or miss your second shot. A shooter with a hot hand will have shots that are not independent of one another. Specifically, if the shooter makes his first shot, the hot hand model says he will have a higher probability of making his second shot. Let’s suppose for a moment that the hot hand model is valid for Kobe. During his career, the percentage of time Kobe makes a basket (i.e. his shooting percentage) is about 45%, or in probability notation, \\[ P(\\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \\] If he makes the first shot and has a hot hand (not independent shots), then the probability that he makes his second shot would go up to, let’s say, 60%, \\[ P(\\textrm{shot 2 = H} \\, | \\, \\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.60 \\] As a result of these increased probabilites, you’d expect Kobe to have longer streaks. Compare this to the skeptical perspective where Kobe does not have a hot hand, where each shot is independent of the next. If he hit his first shot, the probability that he makes the second is still 0.45. \\[ P(\\textrm{shot 2 = H} \\, | \\, \\textrm{shot 1 = H}) = 0.45 \\] In other words, making the first shot did nothing to effect the probability that he’d make his second shot. If Kobe’s shots are independent, then he’d have the same probability of hitting every shot regardless of his past shots: 45%. Now that we’ve phrased the situation in terms of independent shots, let’s return to the question: how do we tell if Kobe’s shooting streaks are long enough to indicate that he has hot hands? We can compare his streak lengths to someone without hot hands: an independent shooter. Simulations in R While we don’t have any data from a shooter we know to have independent shots, that sort of data is very easy to simulate in R. In a simulation, you set the ground rules of a random process and then the computer uses random numbers to generate an outcome that adheres to those rules. As a simple example, you can simulate flipping a fair coin with the following. outcomes &lt;- c(&quot;heads&quot;, &quot;tails&quot;) sample(outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE) The vector outcomes can be thought of as a hat with two slips of paper in it: one slip says heads and the other says tails. The function sample draws one slip from the hat and tells us if it was a head or a tail. Run the second command listed above several times. Just like when flipping a coin, sometimes you’ll get a heads, sometimes you’ll get a tails, but in the long run, you’d expect to get roughly equal numbers of each. If you wanted to simulate flipping a fair coin 100 times, you could either run the function 100 times or, more simply, adjust the size argument, which governs how many samples to draw (the replace = TRUE argument indicates we put the slip of paper back in the hat before drawing again). Save the resulting vector of heads and tails in a new object called sim_fair_coin. sim_fair_coin &lt;- sample(outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE) To view the results of this simulation, type the name of the object and then use table to count up the number of heads and tails. sim_fair_coin table(sim_fair_coin) Since there are only two elements in outcomes, the probability that we “flip” a coin and it lands heads is 0.5. Say we’re trying to simulate an unfair coin that we know only lands heads 20% of the time. We can adjust for this by adding an argument called prob, which provides a vector of two probability weights. sim_unfair_coin &lt;- sample(outcomes, size = 100, replace = TRUE, prob = c(0.2, 0.8)) prob=c(0.2, 0.8) indicates that for the two elements in the outcomes vector, we want to select the first one, heads, with probability 0.2 and the second one, tails with probability 0.8. Another way of thinking about this is to think of the outcome space as a bag of 10 chips, where 2 chips are labeled “head” and 8 chips “tail”. Therefore at each draw, the probability of drawing a chip that says “head”&quot; is 20%, and “tail” is 80%. In your simulation of flipping the unfair coin 100 times, how many flips came up heads? In a sense, we’ve shrunken the size of the slip of paper that says “heads”, making it less likely to be drawn and we’ve increased the size of the slip of paper saying “tails”, making it more likely to be drawn. When we simulated the fair coin, both slips of paper were the same size. This happens by default if you don’t provide a prob argument; all elements in the outcomes vector have an equal probability of being drawn. If you want to learn more about sample or any other function, recall that you can always check out its help file. ?sample Simulating the Independent Shooter Simulating a basketball player who has independent shots uses the same mechanism that we use to simulate a coin flip. To simulate a single shot from an independent shooter with a shooting percentage of 50% we type, outcomes &lt;- c(&quot;H&quot;, &quot;M&quot;) sim_basket &lt;- sample(outcomes, size = 1, replace = TRUE) To make a valid comparison between Kobe and our simulated independent shooter, we need to align both their shooting percentage and the number of attempted shots. What change needs to be made to the sample function so that it reflects a shooting percentage of 45%? Make this adjustment, then run a simulation to sample 133 shots. Assign the output of this simulation to a new object called sim_basket. Note that we’ve named the new vector sim_basket, the same name that we gave to the previous vector reflecting a shooting percentage of 50%. In this situation, R overwrites the old object with the new one, so always make sure that you don’t need the information in an old vector before reassigning its name. With the results of the simulation saved as sim_basket, we have the data necessary to compare Kobe to our independent shooter. We can look at Kobe’s data alongside our simulated data. kobe$basket sim_basket Both data sets represent the results of 133 shot attempts, each with the same shooting percentage of 45%. We know that our simulated data is from a shooter that has independent shots. That is, we know the simulated shooter does not have a hot hand. On your own Comparing Kobe Bryant to the Independent Shooter Using calc_streak, compute the streak lengths of sim_basket. Describe the distribution of streak lengths. What is the typical streak length for this simulated independent shooter with a 45% shooting percentage? How long is the player’s longest streak of baskets in 133 shots? If you were to run the simulation of the independent shooter a second time, how would you expect its streak distribution to compare to the distribution from the question above? Exactly the same? Somewhat similar? Totally different? Explain your reasoning. How does Kobe Bryant’s distribution of streak lengths compare to the distribution of streak lengths for the simulated shooter? Using this comparison, do you have evidence that the hot hand model fits Kobe’s shooting patterns? Explain.

["distributions.html", "Distributions The Data The normal distribution Evaluating the normal distribution Normal probabilities On Your Own", " Distributions The source for this topic is the Open Intro labs https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php In this lab we’ll investigate the probability distribution that is most central to statistics: the normal distribution. If we are confident that our data are nearly normal, that opens the door to many powerful statistical methods. Here we’ll use the graphical tools of R to assess the normality of our data and also learn how to generate random numbers from a normal distribution. The Data This week we’ll be working with measurements of body dimensions. This data set contains measurements from 247 men and 260 women, most of whom were considered healthy young adults. load(&quot;data/bdims.RData&quot;) Let’s take a quick peek at the first few rows of the data. head(bdims) You’ll see that for every observation we have 25 measurements, many of which are either diameters or girths. A key to the variable names can be found at http://www.openintro.org/stat/data/bdims.php, but we’ll be focusing on just three columns to get started: weight in kg (wgt), height in cm (hgt), and sex (1 indicates male, 0 indicates female). Since males and females tend to have different body dimensions, it will be useful to create two additional data sets: one with only men and another with only women. mdims &lt;- subset(bdims, sex == 1) fdims &lt;- subset(bdims, sex == 0) Make a histogram of men’s heights and a histogram of women’s heights. How would you compare the various aspects of the two distributions? The normal distribution In your description of the distributions, did you use words like bell-shaped or normal? It’s tempting to say so when faced with a unimodal symmetric distribution. To see how accurate that description is, we can plot a normal distribution curve on top of a histogram to see how closely the data follow a normal distribution. This normal curve should have the same mean and standard deviation as the data. We’ll be working with women’s heights, so let’s store them as a separate object and then calculate some statistics that will be referenced later. fhgtmean &lt;- mean(fdims$hgt) fhgtsd &lt;- sd(fdims$hgt) Next we make a density histogram to use as the backdrop and use the lines function to overlay a normal probability curve. The difference between a frequency histogram and a density histogram is that while in a frequency histogram the heights of the bars add up to the total number of observations, in a density histogram the areas of the bars add up to 1. The area of each bar can be calculated as simply the height times the width of the bar. Using a density histogram allows us to properly overlay a normal distribution curve over the histogram since the curve is a normal probability density function. Frequency and density histograms both display the same exact shape; they only differ in their y-axis. You can verify this by comparing the frequency histogram you constructed earlier and the density histogram created by the commands below. hist(fdims$hgt, probability = TRUE) x &lt;- 140:190 y &lt;- dnorm(x = x, mean = fhgtmean, sd = fhgtsd) lines(x = x, y = y, col = &quot;blue&quot;) After plotting the density histogram with the first command, we create the x- and y-coordinates for the normal curve. We chose the x range as 140 to 190 in order to span the entire range of fheight. To create y, we use dnorm to calculate the density of each of those x-values in a distribution that is normal with mean fhgtmean and standard deviation fhgtsd. The final command draws a curve on the existing plot (the density histogram) by connecting each of the points specified by x and y. The argument col simply sets the color for the line to be drawn. If we left it out, the line would be drawn in black. The top of the curve is cut off because the limits of the x- and y-axes are set to best fit the histogram. To adjust the y-axis you can add a third argument to the histogram function: ylim = c(0, 0.06). Based on the this plot, does it appear that the data follow a nearly normal distribution? Evaluating the normal distribution Eyeballing the shape of the histogram is one way to determine if the data appear to be nearly normally distributed, but it can be frustrating to decide just how close the histogram is to the curve. An alternative approach involves constructing a normal probability plot, also called a normal Q-Q plot for “quantile-quantile”. qqnorm(fdims$hgt) qqline(fdims$hgt) A data set that is nearly normal will result in a probability plot where the points closely follow the line. Any deviations from normality leads to deviations of these points from the line. The plot for female heights shows points that tend to follow the line but with some errant points towards the tails. We’re left with the same problem that we encountered with the histogram above: how close is close enough? A useful way to address this question is to rephrase it as: what do probability plots look like for data that I know came from a normal distribution? We can answer this by simulating data from a normal distribution using rnorm. sim_norm &lt;- rnorm(n = length(fdims$hgt), mean = fhgtmean, sd = fhgtsd) The first argument indicates how many numbers you’d like to generate, which we specify to be the same number of heights in the fdims data set using the length function. The last two arguments determine the mean and standard deviation of the normal distribution from which the simulated sample will be generated. We can take a look at the shape of our simulated data set, sim_norm, as well as its normal probability plot. Make a normal probability plot of sim_norm. Do all of the points fall on the line? How does this plot compare to the probability plot for the real data? Even better than comparing the original plot to a single plot generated from a normal distribution is to compare it to many more plots using the following function. It may be helpful to click the zoom button in the plot window. qqnormsim(fdims$hgt) Does the normal probability plot for fdims$hgt look similar to the plots created for the simulated data? That is, do plots provide evidence that the female heights are nearly normal? Using the same technique, determine whether or not female weights appear to come from a normal distribution. Normal probabilities Okay, so now you have a slew of tools to judge whether or not a variable is normally distributed. Why should we care? It turns out that statisticians know a lot about the normal distribution. Once we decide that a random variable is approximately normal, we can answer all sorts of questions about that variable related to probability. Take, for example, the question of, “What is the probability that a randomly chosen young adult female is taller than 6 feet (about 182 cm)?” (The study that published this data set is clear to point out that the sample was not random and therefore inference to a general population is not suggested. We do so here only as an exercise.) If we assume that female heights are normally distributed (a very close approximation is also okay), we can find this probability by calculating a Z score and consulting a Z table (also called a normal probability table). In R, this is done in one step with the function pnorm. 1 - pnorm(q = 182, mean = fhgtmean, sd = fhgtsd) Note that the function pnorm gives the area under the normal curve below a given value, q, with a given mean and standard deviation. Since we’re interested in the probability that someone is taller than 182 cm, we have to take one minus that probability. Assuming a normal distribution has allowed us to calculate a theoretical probability. If we want to calculate the probability empirically, we simply need to determine how many observations fall above 182 then divide this number by the total sample size. sum(fdims$hgt &gt; 182) / length(fdims$hgt) Although the probabilities are not exactly the same, they are reasonably close. The closer that your distribution is to being normal, the more accurate the theoretical probabilities will be. Write out two probability questions that you would like to answer; one regarding female heights and one regarding female weights. Calculate the those probabilities using both the theoretical normal distribution as well as the empirical distribution (four probabilities in all). Which variable, height or weight, had a closer agreement between the two methods? On Your Own Now let’s consider some of the other variables in the body dimensions data set. Using the figures at the end of the exercises, match the histogram to its normal probability plot. All of the variables have been standardized (first subtract the mean, then divide by the standard deviation), so the units won’t be of any help. If you are uncertain based on these figures, generate the plots in R to check. a. The histogram for female biiliac (pelvic) diameter (bii.di) belongs to normal probability plot letter ____. b. The histogram for female elbow diameter (elb.di) belongs to normal probability plot letter ____. c. The histogram for general age (age) belongs to normal probability plot letter ____. d. The histogram for female chest depth (che.de) belongs to normal probability plot letter ____. Note that normal probability plots C and D have a slight stepwise pattern. Why do you think this is the case? As you can see, normal probability plots can be used both to assess normality and visualize skewness. Make a normal probability plot for female knee diameter (kne.di). Based on this normal probability plot, is this variable left skewed, symmetric, or right skewed? Use a histogram to confirm your findings. histQQmatch This is a product of OpenIntro that is released under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported.

["trifecta.html", "How to Judge Visualizations", " How to Judge Visualizations Read Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup Kaiser Fung has a useful framework for judging the quality of data visualizations. He calls his framework the Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup. To make that shorter, we’ll just call this framework the Trifecta Checkup. This framework boils down to the following 3 questions: What is the question? What does the data say? What does the visual say? Each visualization can be labeled according to which question(s) it does not answer well. For example, a chart with a meaningful question and relevant data, but ineffective visuals, would be labeled v. A chart that gets the data and question wrong, but has a nice visual, would be labeled qd. "],
["inference.html", "Intro to Inference The data The unknown sampling distribution Interlude: The for loop Sample size and the sampling distribution On your own", " Intro to Inference The source for this topic is the Open Intro labs https://www.openintro.org/stat/labs.php In this lab, we investigate the ways in which the statistics from a random sample of data can serve as point estimates for population parameters. We’re interested in formulating a sampling distribution of our estimate in order to learn about the properties of the estimate, such as its distribution. The data We consider real estate data from the city of Ames, Iowa. The details of every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City Assessor’s office. Our particular focus for this lab will be all residential home sales in Ames between 2006 and 2010. This collection represents our population of interest. In this lab we would like to learn about these home sales by taking smaller samples from the full population. Let’s load the data. load(&quot;data/ames.RData&quot;) We see that there are quite a few variables in the data set, enough to do a very in-depth analysis. For this lab, we’ll restrict our attention to just two of the variables: the above ground living area of the house in square feet (Gr.Liv.Area) and the sale price (SalePrice). To save some effort throughout the lab, create two variables with short names that represent these two variables. area &lt;- ames$Gr.Liv.Area price &lt;- ames$SalePrice Let’s look at the distribution of area in our population of home sales by calculating a few summary statistics and making a histogram. summary(area) hist(area) Describe this population distribution. The unknown sampling distribution In this lab we have access to the entire population, but this is rarely the case in real life. Gathering information on an entire population is often extremely costly or impossible. Because of this, we often take a sample of the population and use that to understand the properties of the population. If we were interested in estimating the mean living area in Ames based on a sample, we can use the following command to survey the population. samp1 &lt;- sample(area, 50) This command collects a simple random sample of size 50 from the vector area, which is assigned to samp1. This is like going into the City Assessor’s database and pulling up the files on 50 random home sales. Working with these 50 files would be considerably simpler than working with all 2930 home sales. Describe the distribution of this sample. How does it compare to the distribution of the population? If we’re interested in estimating the average living area in homes in Ames using the sample, our best single guess is the sample mean. mean(samp1) Depending on which 50 homes you selected, your estimate could be a bit above or a bit below the true population mean of 1499.69 square feet. In general, though, the sample mean turns out to be a pretty good estimate of the average living area, and we were able to get it by sampling less than 3% of the population. Take a second sample, also of size 50, and call it samp2. How does the mean of samp2 compare with the mean of samp1? Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. Which would you think would provide a more accurate estimate of the population mean? Not surprisingly, every time we take another random sample, we get a different sample mean. It’s useful to get a sense of just how much variability we should expect when estimating the population mean this way. The distribution of sample means, called the sampling distribution, can help us understand this variability. In this lab, because we have access to the population, we can build up the sampling distribution for the sample mean by repeating the above steps many times. Here we will generate 5000 samples and compute the sample mean of each. sample_means50 &lt;- rep(NA, 5000) for(i in 1:5000){ samp &lt;- sample(area, 50) sample_means50[i] &lt;- mean(samp) } hist(sample_means50) If you would like to adjust the bin width of your histogram to show a little more detail, you can do so by changing the breaks argument. hist(sample_means50, breaks = 25) Here we use R to take 5000 samples of size 50 from the population, calculate the mean of each sample, and store each result in a vector called sample_means50. On the next page, we’ll review how this set of code works. How many elements are there in sample_means50? Describe the sampling distribution, and be sure to specifically note its center. Would you expect the distribution to change if we instead collected 50,000 sample means? Interlude: The for loop Let’s take a break from the statistics for a moment to let that last block of code sink in. You have just run your first for loop, a cornerstone of computer programming. The idea behind the for loop is iteration: it allows you to execute code as many times as you want without having to type out every iteration. In the case above, we wanted to iterate the two lines of code inside the curly braces that take a random sample of size 50 from area then save the mean of that sample into the sample_means50 vector. Without the for loop, this would be painful: sample_means50 &lt;- rep(NA, 5000) samp &lt;- sample(area, 50) sample_means50[1] &lt;- mean(samp) samp &lt;- sample(area, 50) sample_means50[2] &lt;- mean(samp) samp &lt;- sample(area, 50) sample_means50[3] &lt;- mean(samp) samp &lt;- sample(area, 50) sample_means50[4] &lt;- mean(samp) and so on… With the for loop, these thousands of lines of code are compressed into a handful of lines. We’ve added one extra line to the code below, which prints the variable i during each iteration of the for loop. Run this code. sample_means50 &lt;- rep(NA, 5000) for(i in 1:5000){ samp &lt;- sample(area, 50) sample_means50[i] &lt;- mean(samp) print(i) } Let’s consider this code line by line to figure out what it does. In the first line we initialized a vector. In this case, we created a vector of 5000 zeros called sample_means50. This vector will will store values generated within the for loop. The second line calls the for loop itself. The syntax can be loosely read as, “for every element i from 1 to 5000, run the following lines of code”. You can think of i as the counter that keeps track of which loop you’re on. Therefore, more precisely, the loop will run once when i = 1, then once when i = 2, and so on up to i = 5000. The body of the for loop is the part inside the curly braces, and this set of code is run for each value of i. Here, on every loop, we take a random sample of size 50 from area, take its mean, and store it as the \\(i\\)th element of sample_means50. In order to display that this is really happening, we asked R to print i at each iteration. This line of code is optional and is only used for displaying what’s going on while the for loop is running. The for loop allows us to not just run the code 5000 times, but to neatly package the results, element by element, into the empty vector that we initialized at the outset. To make sure you understand what you’ve done in this loop, try running a smaller version. Initialize a vector of 100 zeros called sample_means_small. Run a loop that takes a sample of size 50 from area and stores the sample mean in sample_means_small, but only iterate from 1 to 100. Print the output to your screen (type sample_means_small into the console and press enter). How many elements are there in this object called sample_means_small? What does each element represent? Sample size and the sampling distribution Mechanics aside, let’s return to the reason we used a for loop: to compute a sampling distribution, specifically, this one. hist(sample_means50) The sampling distribution that we computed tells us much about estimating the average living area in homes in Ames. Because the sample mean is an unbiased estimator, the sampling distribution is centered at the true average living area of the the population, and the spread of the distribution indicates how much variability is induced by sampling only 50 home sales. To get a sense of the effect that sample size has on our distribution, let’s build up two more sampling distributions: one based on a sample size of 10 and another based on a sample size of 100. sample_means10 &lt;- rep(NA, 5000) sample_means100 &lt;- rep(NA, 5000) for(i in 1:5000){ samp &lt;- sample(area, 10) sample_means10[i] &lt;- mean(samp) samp &lt;- sample(area, 100) sample_means100[i] &lt;- mean(samp) } Here we’re able to use a single for loop to build two distributions by adding additional lines inside the curly braces. Don’t worry about the fact that samp is used for the name of two different objects. In the second command of the for loop, the mean of samp is saved to the relevant place in the vector sample_means10. With the mean saved, we’re now free to overwrite the object samp with a new sample, this time of size 100. In general, anytime you create an object using a name that is already in use, the old object will get replaced with the new one. To see the effect that different sample sizes have on the sampling distribution, plot the three distributions on top of one another. par(mfrow = c(3, 1)) xlimits &lt;- range(sample_means10) hist(sample_means10, breaks = 20, xlim = xlimits) hist(sample_means50, breaks = 20, xlim = xlimits) hist(sample_means100, breaks = 20, xlim = xlimits) The first command specifies that you’d like to divide the plotting area into 3 rows and 1 column of plots (to return to the default setting of plotting one at a time, use par(mfrow = c(1, 1))). The breaks argument specifies the number of bins used in constructing the histogram. The xlim argument specifies the range of the x-axis of the histogram, and by setting it equal to xlimits for each histogram, we ensure that all three histograms will be plotted with the same limits on the x-axis. When the sample size is larger, what happens to the center? What about the spread? On your own So far, we have only focused on estimating the mean living area in homes in Ames. Now you’ll try to estimate the mean home price. Take a random sample of size 50 from price. Using this sample, what is your best point estimate of the population mean? Since you have access to the population, simulate the sampling distribution for \\(\\bar{x}_{price}\\) by taking 5000 samples from the population of size 50 and computing 5000 sample means. Store these means in a vector called sample_means50. Plot the data, then describe the shape of this sampling distribution. Based on this sampling distribution, what would you guess the mean home price of the population to be? Finally, calculate and report the population mean. Change your sample size from 50 to 150, then compute the sampling distribution using the same method as above, and store these means in a new vector called sample_means150. Describe the shape of this sampling distribution, and compare it to the sampling distribution for a sample size of 50. Based on this sampling distribution, what would you guess to be the mean sale price of homes in Ames? Of the sampling distributions from 2 and 3, which has a smaller spread? If we’re concerned with making estimates that are more often close to the true value, would we prefer a distribution with a large or small spread?
