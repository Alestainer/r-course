Student Learning Objectives To be familiar with standard techniques for visualizing data, including heat maps, contour plots, (look at the list in the Data Visualization book) To be able to transform raw data into formats suitable for analysis To be able to perform basic exploratory analysis To be able to create data visualizations There is no prerequisite for this course. Resources Required Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation: Available as a free PDF (https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) or for $8.49 on Amazon. R Graphics Cookbook Recommended: ggplot2 Cheatsheet Course Requirements Grades for this course will be based on weekly assignments (30%), project assignments (30%), the project proposal (5%), the final project deliverable (15%), and final project presentation participation (20%). Weekly assignments (30%) Weekly assignments are short R excercises. Each exercise should take no longer than 15 minutes. You will typically be given time to complete the exercise in class the day the assignment is given. The assignment will be in the form of R Markdown file (*.Rmd). You will submit the completed assignments via classroom.google.com by the following class period. Individual Project Project assignments (30%) Each week, leading up to the project proposal, you will be given an assignment that is designed to provide you with an organized workflow for approaching new data science projects. Project assignments are submitted via classroom.google.com, with the exception of the two presentations Project proposal presentation (5%) This presentation should be less than 2 minutes. You simply need to communicate the core question your project seeks to answer and the dataset(s) you will be using to answer this question. Final project (15%) The final project will be an R Markdown document which communicates your project question, the data you used, and your results. Final project presentation participation (20%) Your final project participation grade is based on a combination of your own presentation and the feedback you provide to your classmates. Schedule The following schedule is tentative and subject to change.

Make sure that the rmarkdown library is installed: install.packages(&quot;rmarkdown&quot;) For each assignment, you will create an R Markdown file (*.Rmd) and submit that file by the following class session using classroom.google.com 1.2 Working with data already loaded into R Base R comes with a set of sample data that is useful for illustrating techniques in R. Run the following command to see a list of the datasets in the core library datasets: library(help = &quot;datasets&quot;) These datasets are accessible automatically. We’ll start with the Swiss Fertility and Socioeconomic Inicators (1888) dataset. See a description of the dataset by using the help command, either ?swiss or help(swiss). This dataset is technically a data.frame, which you can see by using the command class(swiss). For more information on data.frames take a look at the documentation(help(data.frame)) 1.2.1 Numeric summaries Here are a few ways we can summarize a dataset: head() shows us the first six rows of a data.frame. head(swiss) ## Fertility Agriculture Examination Education Catholic ## Courtelary 80.2 17.0 15 12 9.96 ## Delemont 83.1 45.1 6 9 84.84 ## Franches-Mnt 92.5 39.7 5 5 93.40 ## Moutier 85.8 36.5 12 7 33.77 ## Neuveville 76.9 43.5 17 15 5.16 ## Porrentruy 76.1 35.3 9 7 90.57 ## Infant.Mortality ## Courtelary 22.2 ## Delemont 22.2 ## Franches-Mnt 20.2 ## Moutier 20.3 ## Neuveville 20.6 ## Porrentruy 26.6 summary() provides summary statistics for each column in a data.frame. summary(swiss) ## Fertility Agriculture Examination Education ## Min. :35.00 Min. : 1.20 Min. : 3.00 Min. : 1.00 ## 1st Qu.:64.70 1st Qu.:35.90 1st Qu.:12.00 1st Qu.: 6.00 ## Median :70.40 Median :54.10 Median :16.00 Median : 8.00 ## Mean :70.14 Mean :50.66 Mean :16.49 Mean :10.98 ## 3rd Qu.:78.45 3rd Qu.:67.65 3rd Qu.:22.00 3rd Qu.:12.00 ## Max. :92.50 Max. :89.70 Max. :37.00 Max. :53.00 ## Catholic Infant.Mortality ## Min. : 2.150 Min. :10.80 ## 1st Qu.: 5.195 1st Qu.:18.15 ## Median : 15.140 Median :20.00 ## Mean : 41.144 Mean :19.94 ## 3rd Qu.: 93.125 3rd Qu.:21.70 ## Max. :100.000 Max. :26.60 1.2.2 Visual summaries Scatterplot matrix (default plot of a data.frame): plot(swiss) # or pairs(swiss) Scatterplot of two dimensions plot(swiss[,c(&quot;Education&quot;, &quot;Fertility&quot;)]) # or plot(swiss[4,1]) # or plot(swiss$Education, swiss$Fertility) # or plot(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Education) Smoothed Scatterplot of two dimensions smoothScatter(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Examination) Scatterplot with a loess (locally weighted polynomial regression) scatter.smooth(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Agriculture) 1.2.3 Distribution plots Histograms: hist(swiss$Catholic) Stem-and-Leaf Plots: stem(swiss$Fertility) ## ## The decimal point is 1 digit(s) to the right of the | ## ## 3 | 5 ## 4 | 35 ## 5 | 46778 ## 6 | 124455556678899 ## 7 | 01223346677899 ## 8 | 0233467 ## 9 | 223 Kernel density plot (and add a rug showing where observation occur): plot(density(swiss$Fertility)) rug(swiss$Fertility) Boxplots: boxplot(swiss) 1.2.3.1 More complicated charts Conditioning plots: coplot(swiss$Fertility ~ swiss$Examination | as.factor(swiss$Catholic &gt; 50)) Star plots (half-star plots here): stars(swiss, key.loc = c(15,1), flip.labels = FALSE, full = FALSE) 1.3 Assignment Choose a dataset from datasets (library(help = &quot;datasets&quot;) will show you a list) and create 5 charts in an R Markdown file from the example charts above.

He calls his framework the Junk Charts Trifecta Checkup. To make that shorter, we’ll just call this framework the Trifecta Checkup. This framework boils down to the following 3 questions: What is the question? What does the data say? What does the visual say? Each visualization can be labeled according to which question(s) it does not answer well. For example, a chart with a meaningful question and relevant data, but ineffective visuals, would be labeled v. A chart that gets the data and question wrong, but has a nice visual, would be labeled qd. 3.3 Assignment Assign a label to each of the following visualizations based on the Trifecta Checkup. Provide at least one sentence per question defending your chosen labels. "]
