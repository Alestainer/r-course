# ggplot2 Extensions and Scatterplot Matrices (GGally) {#ggplot-exts}

## Data 

The US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducts the American Time Use Survey (ATUS). You can download
the text form of the ATUS by going to the [BLS data page](https://www.bls.gov/data/), finding the
section labelled Spending & Time Use, then clicking on the "Text Files" button on the row for
the ATUS. Or by using the following link:

https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/tu/

The file `tu.txt` contains the documentation for the time use (tu) survey data. Section 2 of that file
provides descriptions of each of the files in the `pub/time.series/tu` folder. From that list we can 
see that `tu.series` will give us a list of the available series.

### Downloading a file from the internet

While you can manually download the files from the above URL, `download.file()` lets you download files from within R.
The first argument is the URL of the resource you want to download. The second argument is the destination for the file.

```
download.file("https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/tu/tu.txt", "data/tu/tu.txt")
download.file("https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/tu/tu.series", "data/tu/tu.series")
download.file("https://download.bls.gov/pub/time.series/tu/tu.data.0.Current", "data/tu/tu.data.0.Current")
```

```{r}
library(readr)
series_defn <- read_tsv("data/tu/tu.series")
series_defn
```

## [ggplot2 extensions](http://www.ggplot2-exts.org/gallery)

There are many extensions the community have made that build on ggplot. The following link
provides a gallery of many of these extensions:

## scatterplot matrix (GGally::scatmat)

One particular library, [GGally](http://ggobi.github.io/ggally/), has a great set of visualizations
to extend those that come prebuilt with `ggplot`. One common visualization tool that is missing from
ggplot is the scatterplot matrix. While base R provides `splom()` in the `lattice` library, `GGally::ggpairs`
and `GGally::ggscatmat`


## GGally::glyphs
