# Syllabus {-}

## Office Hours {-}
Monday 2-3 PM and Tuesday 3-4 PM, or by appointment, Saunders 509, jrpage at hawaii dot edu.

## Student Learning Objectives {-}

1. To be familiar with standard techniques for visualizing data, including heat maps, contour plots, (look at the list in the Data Visualization book)
2. To be able to transform raw data into formats suitable for analysis
3. To be able to perform basic exploratory analysis
4. To be able to create data visualizations

There is no prerequisite for this course.

## Resources {-}

### Required {-}

Introductory Statistics with Randomization and Simulation: Available as a free PDF (https://www.openintro.org/stat/textbook.php?stat_book=isrs) or for $8.49 on Amazon.

R Graphics Cookbook

### Recommended: {-}

ggplot2 Cheatsheet

## Course Requirements {-}

Grades for this course will be based on weekly assignments (30%), project assignments (30%), the project proposal (5%), the final project deliverable (15%), and final project presentation participation (20%).

### Weekly assignments (30%) {-}

Weekly assignments are short R excercises. Each exercise should take no longer than 15 minutes. You will typically be given time to complete the exercise in class the day the assignment is given. The assignment will be in the form of R Markdown file (*.Rmd). You will submit the completed assignments via [classroom.google.com](https//classroom.google.com) by the following class period. 

## Individual Project {-}

### Project assignments (30%) {-}

Each week, leading up to the project proposal, you will be given an assignment that is designed to provide you with an organized workflow for approaching new data science projects. Project assignments are submitted via [classroom.google.com](https//classroom.google.com), with the exception of the two presentations

### Project proposal presentation (5%) {-}

This presentation should be less than 2 minutes. You simply need to communicate the core question your project seeks to answer and the dataset(s) you will be using to answer this question.

### Final project (15%) {-}

The final project will be an R Markdown document which communicates your project question, the data you used, and your results. 

### Final project presentation participation (20%) {-}

Your final project participation grade is based on a combination of your own presentation and the feedback you provide to your classmates.
